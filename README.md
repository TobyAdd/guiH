# note
guiH is difficult to code, and during the coding process, I didn't anticipate the nuances I encountered, which completely broke the framework. Unfortunately, I wasted time and could have already fixed GDH on the existing graphical interface (ImGui) instead of writing my own. The project is closed.

- very simple graphic library (you can draw squares, outlines, circles, all of this with your own color)
- text rendering (windows only cuz winapi :D)
- powered by govnocode ultra
# example
[see at the code i've already written, i'm too lazy to explain basic things for writing components](https://github.com/TobyAdd/guiH/blob/main/Example/src/dllmain.cpp)
